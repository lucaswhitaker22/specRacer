# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A browser-based, text-driven MMO racing game where players select real car models from a licensed dataset and compete in persistent leagues. The game emphasizes strategic racing through text commands and real-time updates, incorporating authentic car specifications and racing mechanics like tire wear, fuel management, and pit strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to select from a curated list of real car models with authentic specifications, so that I can experience realistic racing performance differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player accesses the car selection interface THEN the system SHALL display 2-3 available car models with their specifications
2. WHEN a player views car specifications THEN the system SHALL show horsepower, weight, drag coefficient, frontal area, drivetrain, tire grip, gear ratios, aero downforce, fuel economy, 0-60 mph, and top speed
3. WHEN a player selects a car model THEN the system SHALL validate the selection and assign it to their profile
4. IF a car model is already selected by the maximum allowed players THEN the system SHALL prevent further selections and display availability status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control my car through text commands during races, so that I can implement racing strategies and respond to race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a race is active THEN the system SHALL accept text commands for accelerate, brake, shift, and pit actions
2. WHEN a player enters a valid command THEN the system SHALL process the command within the current race tick
3. WHEN a player enters an invalid command THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback about the error
4. WHEN multiple commands are entered rapidly THEN the system SHALL queue and process them in order within game tick constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive real-time race updates and position information, so that I can make informed strategic decisions during the race.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a race is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide turn/update logs describing race events
2. WHEN race positions change THEN the system SHALL update player positions in real-time or within short tick intervals
3. WHEN significant race events occur (overtakes, pit stops, incidents) THEN the system SHALL broadcast descriptive text updates to all participants
4. WHEN a race tick completes THEN the system SHALL display time splits, fuel levels, tire wear status, and current positions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to manage tire wear and fuel consumption strategically, so that I can optimize my race performance over the full race distance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a car is racing THEN the system SHALL continuously calculate and update tire wear based on driving style and track conditions
2. WHEN a car is racing THEN the system SHALL continuously calculate and update fuel consumption based on car specifications and driving behavior
3. WHEN tire wear reaches critical levels THEN the system SHALL reduce car performance and notify the player
4. WHEN fuel levels become low THEN the system SHALL warn the player and reduce engine performance if fuel runs out
5. WHEN a player initiates a pit stop THEN the system SHALL allow tire changes and refueling with appropriate time penalties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to participate in persistent league races on a dedicated track, so that I can compete with other players over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL provide one race track with defined characteristics
2. WHEN players join a race THEN the system SHALL support multiple concurrent participants
3. WHEN a race completes THEN the system SHALL record results and update league standings
4. WHEN race results are generated THEN the system SHALL log detailed race information including lap times, positions, and strategic decisions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the game to use authentic car data within legal licensing constraints, so that the game provides realistic and legally compliant racing experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN car specifications are implemented THEN the system SHALL use only properly licensed real car data
2. WHEN car models are added THEN the system SHALL maintain year-accurate specifications to a fixed baseline per model
3. WHEN displaying car information THEN the system SHALL ensure all data remains within licensing agreement terms
4. IF licensing issues arise THEN the system SHALL have fallback procedures to maintain game functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly in my web browser with real-time communication, so that I can have a responsive racing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player accesses the game THEN the system SHALL load and run in a standard web browser
2. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket or HTTP long-polling for communication
3. WHEN multiple players are racing THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent game state across all clients
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle disconnections gracefully and allow reconnection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want my race progress and league standings to persist between sessions, so that I can build long-term competitive achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player completes actions THEN the system SHALL store all race data, player profiles, and league standings persistently
2. WHEN a player returns to the game THEN the system SHALL restore their previous state and standings
3. WHEN race sessions end THEN the system SHALL maintain session state for reconnection purposes
4. WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all player data and game state
